		<h2>The History</h2>
		<p>To many, the Watermelon is seen only as a commonplace fruit, but the watermelon actually has long and surprising history.</p>
		<h3>5000 years in the making</h3>
		<p></p>
		<h3>War of the melon</h3>
		<p></p>
		<h3>Watermelon Shapes</h3>
		<p>Watermelons, due to their round nature have a low packing efficiency. As such they take up a lot of unnecessary space in the 
		refrigerator (or any other place where watermelons are stored). This is not a problem if you have excess space, but if you lack
		the space or just don't want your watermelon to roll, there are watermelon in a variety of shapes to suit your needs.</p>
