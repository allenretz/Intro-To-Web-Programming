		<h2>The Introduction</h2>
		<p>All of these pages are about watermelons. When I was originally making this project, I was going to make it set of
		Do's and Dont's for creating a website. However, three of the colors I chose in my theme reminded me of a watermelon.
		As Such I decided to make my project more whimsical and make it entirely about watermelons.
		First, I created a short story about a watermelon named Warren.
		Secondly, researched the  history of the watermelon.
		Finally, I created a game about watermelons.</p>
