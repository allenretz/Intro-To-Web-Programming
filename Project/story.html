		<h2>The Story</h2>
		<p>Warren the Watermelon was wandering around Worland Wyoming on Wednesday when Wally, one of Warren's Wacky friends, waddled
		in front of wayward wagon.</p>
		<p>"Watch Out Wally!", Warren bellowed.</p>
		<p>Wally weaved out of the way without a minute to spare.</p>
		<p>"Wow! Thanks Warren!" Wally Wailed, "What would I do without you?"</p>
		<p>Warren wondered where Wally was going and how Wally winked-at the wild wagon. Wally was apparently on his way to Wanda and Wade's wedding.
		He was worried weather his waffle iron was a worthy wedding gift. Warren assured Wally that a waffle iron was a wonderful gift.</p>
		<h2>The Epilogue</h2>
		<p>After wandering for one hour Warren was ready to watch a movie. Warren went to his home on Westward way and watched Wargames.
		Wally went to Wanda and Wade's wedding where his waffle iron was well received. Wade and Wanda were married at 1:21 p.m. The wayward wagon
		wrecked with Warlands weights center where it no longer could will to be wayward.
